# I'm Ariel 

I'm a Data Science & AI student focused on building real-world machine learning projects and developing an international career in Europe.

I work mainly with Python, SQL and scikit-learn, and I'm currently learning Docker, FastAPI and cloud services to build end-to-end data applications.

### What I'm working on
- An end-to-end ML pipeline project (cleaning, feature engineering, CV, deployment)
- A business intelligence dashboard with Streamlit & Python
- Improving my technical interview skills (SQL, Python, ML fundamentals)

###  Tech toolbox
Python • pandas • numpy • scikit-learn • SQL • Git/GitHub • Streamlit  
Docker • FastAPI (learning) • AWS basics (learning)

### Goals
- Keep improving my technical knowledge in Machine Learning, data engineering and cloud technologies.
- Develop a solid understanding of real-world data workflows: from data cleaning to deployment.
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills through hands-on projects.
- Become fluent in technical English for interviews and cross-border teamwork.
- Learn how to design, build and deploy complete AI products that deliver real business value.
- Build a strong international profile and work as a Data Scientist in Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany or remotely for global companies.
